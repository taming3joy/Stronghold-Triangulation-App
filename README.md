# Stronghold Triangulation Calculator 🧭

This is my **first GitHub project**, a Python-based calculator for estimating the location of a Minecraft stronghold using triangulation. It's built with a simple **Tkinter** GUI.

## 🚀 What It Does

The calculator currently supports:
- Input of **2 coordinate sets** (where you threw the Eye of Ender)
- Input of the **angle of each Eye throw** (in degrees)
- Calculation of the estimated **stronghold coordinates**

This is useful for Minecraft players who want to locate strongholds more accurately using just a few throws and coordinate math.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- Basic math for angle-based intersection

## 📦 Features

### ✅ Current Features:
- GUI interface to enter coordinates and angles
- Computes intersection point based on 2 inputs

### 🔧 Planned Features:
- A **Paste button** to extract coordinates directly from Minecraft's `F3+C` copied string for faster input
- Add a **Distance to stronghold** display and update button to update the current distance to stronghold
- Add a **4,4 coordinate lock**, which adjusts the estimated position to the chunk center where strongholds generate

## 📚 Inspiration

This tool was inspired by Minecraft speedrunners and strategists who use geometry to track down strongholds efficiently.
